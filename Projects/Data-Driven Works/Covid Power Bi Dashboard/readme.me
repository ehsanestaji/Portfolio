As an avid learner and data enthusiast, I recently created a dashboard using PowerBI to visualize and analyze data on the COVID-19 pandemic. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the global spread of the virus, including information on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries by country.

I used a variety of data visualization techniques and interactive elements to make the dashboard user-friendly and engaging. For example, the dashboard includes maps and graphs that show the trends and patterns in the data, as well as filters and slicers that allow users to drill down and explore the data in more detail.

In addition to presenting the raw data, the dashboard also includes insights and analysis based on the data. Overall, my dashboard provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in staying informed about the COVID-19 pandemic.
