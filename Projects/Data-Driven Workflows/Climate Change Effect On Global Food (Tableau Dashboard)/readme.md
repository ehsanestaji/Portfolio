Climate Change and Global Food Production

This project uses data from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) to visualize the effects of climate change on global food production. The data was collected by the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) and includes estimates of crop yields under different climate and environmental conditions.

The visualization was created using Tableau and is intended to highlight the ways in which climate change is impacting food production around the world. The goal is to show the potential consequences of climate change for global food security and to encourage action to mitigate its effects.

Data Sources

The data for this project was obtained from SEDAC, including the following datasets:

    Crop yield estimates
    Climate and environmental data

Visualization

The visualization includes several tabs, each of which shows a different aspect of the data.
Overview

The first tab provides an overview of the data, showing the estimated impacts of climate change on crop yields around the world. This provides a broad view of how these impacts are distributed and how they may change over time.
Regional Trends

The second tab breaks down the data by region, allowing users to see how climate change is expected to affect crop yields in different parts of the world. This tab also includes a filter that allows users to focus on specific regions or countries.
Country-Level Trends

The third tab provides a more detailed view of the data at the country level. This tab includes a filter that allows users to focus on specific countries and see how their crop yields may be impacted by climate change.
Conclusions

The data shows that climate change is likely to have significant impacts on global food production, with some regions and countries being more affected than others. As temperatures rise and precipitation patterns change, the ability of crops to produce food is expected to decline. This has important implications for global food security and highlights the need for action to mitigate the effects of climate change.
Limitations

One limitation of this project is that it is based on data from SEDAC, which may not be the most comprehensive or up-to-date source of information on global food production and climate change. Additionally, the data is based on estimates from crop modeling, which may not fully capture the complex interactions between climate and food production. Finally, the visualization is limited by the data available and the choices made in creating the visualization. It is not intended to be a definitive analysis of the effects of climate change on global food production.
