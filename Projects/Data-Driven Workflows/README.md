## Welcome to my data science portfolio!

I am a data scientist with a strong background in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

In this portfolio, you will find a selection of my projects that demonstrate my skills and experience in the field of data science. Each project includes a brief description, the tools and techniques used, and a summary of my contributions.

### Project 1: Climate Change Effect On Global Food 
This Tableau data visualization explores the potential impact of climate change on global food production using data from Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC). It presents the data in the form of interactive maps, scatter plots, and bar charts, allowing the user to see how crop yields are affected by changes in weather conditions. The visualization aims to highlight the importance of addressing climate change in order to secure the global food supply.

### Project 2: Covid Power Bi Dashboard
The "Covid Power BI Dashboard" is a data visualization that provides an overview of the COVID-19 pandemic using data from various sources. It uses Power BI to present the data in the form of interactive charts, maps, and tables, allowing the user to explore and analyze the data in depth. The dashboard covers a wide range of topics, including cases and deaths by country, vaccination rates, and the economic impact of the pandemic. It is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 situation and help people stay informed about the latest developments.

### Project 3: Google Scholar Scrapping
