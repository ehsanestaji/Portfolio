# About Me

Hi there! My name is Ehsan and I am a passionate learner. I have been working as an assistant professor in mathematics for seven years, where I have developed expertise in graph theory and algebra.

In pursuit of my dreams, I have started a PhD in computer science at the Universit√® du Luxembourg in 2019. I am passionate about learning and self-development, and love using my skills to solve problems and help others.

On my GitHub page, you can find some of my personal certificates, projects, and contributions to open-source projects. I am always looking for opportunities to improve my skills and collaborate with others, so please don't hesitate to reach out and connect with me. Thanks for visiting my page!
