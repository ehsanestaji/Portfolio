# About Me

In the summer of 2013 I graduated with a Ph.D. degree in algebraic graph theory from the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. Having now obtained my degree, I have moved to Hakim Sabzevari University as an assistant professor for seven years.

I’ve always had a natural curiosity and passion for computers. As a child, I loved staring at the black terminal screen. By the age of 10, I was building my first programs in QuickBASIC (in MS-DOS). My passion for computer science continued to develop and I’ve joined the Applied Security and Information Assurance Group, headed by Prof. Dr. Peter Y. A. Ryan (the group is part of the interdisciplinary center for security, reliability, and trust) to obtain another Ph.D. degree in computer sciences from the Universitè du Luxembourg.

If you want to talk about e-voting, machine learning, programming, coding, algebraic graph theory, or anything else, drop me a line. I am currently unavailable for employment, but I am eager to hear from LinkedIn users.
