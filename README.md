# About Me

In the summer of 2013 I graduated with a Ph.D. degree in algebraic graph theory from the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. Having now obtained my degree, I have moved to Hakim Sabzevari University as an assistant professor for seven years.

I’ve always had a natural curiosity and passion for computers. As a child, I loved staring at the black terminal screen. By the age of 10, I was building my first programs in QuickBASIC (in MS-DOS). My passion for computer science continued to develop and I’ve joined the Applied Security and Information Assurance Group, headed by Prof. Dr. Peter Y. A. Ryan (the group is part of the interdisciplinary center for security, reliability, and trust) to obtain another Ph.D. degree in computer sciences from the Universitè du Luxembourg.

If you want to talk about e-voting, machine learning, programming, coding, algebraic graph theory, or anything else, drop me a line. I am currently unavailable for employment, but I am eager to hear from LinkedIn users.

Specialties: 
Mathematics : Algebraic Graph Theory, Network Analysis, Navigation Problems on Graph, Symmetry Properties of Graphs, Technical Software (Maple, Mathematica, Matlab, Sage, GeoGabra, Latex, TikZ)


Computer Sciences : Different Aspects of E-Votings (Design, Usability, Verifiability, Privacy), Machine Learning, Formal Verification Tools ( Easycrypt, Coq ), Web Developer (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL),

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
